<EM>This document contains the release notes for version 2.5 of Squid.
Squid is a WWW Cache application developed by the National Laboratory
for Applied Network Research and members of the Web Caching community.</EM>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Key changes from squid 2.4:</A></H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Major rewrite of proxy authentication to support other schemes
than basic. First in the line is NTLM support but others can
easily be added (minimal digest is present). See the Programmers
Guide for the internals.
Thanks to the SAMBA team for some excellent collaboration on the
NTLM support!
(Robert Collins &amp; Francesco Chemolli)</LI>
<LI>Optimized searching in proxy_auth and ident ACL types. Squid
should now handle large access lists a lot more efficiently.
(Francesco Chemolli)</LI>
<LI>Fixed forwarding/peer loop detection code (Brian Degenhardt) -
now a peer is ignored if it turns out to be us, rather than
committing suicide</LI>
<LI>Changed the internal URL code to obey appendDomain for
internal objects if it needs appending. This fixes weirdnesses
where a machine can think it is "foo.bar.com", and "foo" is
requested.
(Brian Degenhardt)</LI>
<LI>Added the use of Automake to create the Makefile.in's in the
squid source tree. This will allow libtool in the future, and
immediately allows better dependency tracking - with or 
without gcc - as well as the dist-all and distcheck targets
for developers which respectively build a tar.gz and a tar.bz2
distribution, and check that what will be distributed builds.
(Robert Collins)</LI>
<LI>Added TOS and source address selection based on ACLs,
written by Roger Venning. This allows administrators to set
the TOS precedence bits and/or the source IP from a set of
available IPs based upon some ACLs, generally to map different
users to different outgoing links and traffic profiles.</LI>
<LI>Added 'max-conn' option to 'cache_peer'</LI>
<LI>Added SSL gatewaying support, allowing Squid to act as a SSL
server in accelerator setups.</LI>
<LI>Many new authentication helpers.</LI>
<LI>no_cache now applies to cache hits as well as cache misses</LI>
<LI>the Gopher client in Squid has been significantly improved</LI>
<LI>Squid now sanity checks FTP data connections to ensure the
connection is from the requested server. Can be disabled if
needed by turning off the ftp_sanitycheck option.</LI>
<LI>external acl support. A mechanism where flexible ACL checks
can be driven by external helpers. See the external_acl_type
and acl external directives. (MARA Systems AB)</LI>
<LI>Countless other small things and fixes</LI>
<LI>HTML pages generated by Squid or CacheMgr as well as the
ERR documents now contain a doctype declaration so that
browsers know which HTML specification the document uses.
In addition to that they have a new look
(background-color, font) and are valid according to the HTML
standards at www.w3.org.
(Clemens Löser)</LI>
<LI>Login and password send to Basic auth helpers is now URL
escaped to allow for spaces and other "odd" characters in
logins and passwords</LI>
<LI>Proxy Authentication is no longer blindly forwarded to peer
caches if not used locally. If forwarding of proxy authentication
is desired then it must now be configured with the login=PASS
cache_peer option.</LI>
<LI>Responses with Vary: in the header are now cached by squid.
(Henrik Nordstrom).</LI>
<LI>Support for openBSD pf interface in interception mode.</LI>
<LI>It is now possible to send complex arguments to helpers
by quoting the arguments by " and/or \ </LI>
<LI>The directory structure has changed slightly. The squid binary
has been moved into sbin, errors and icons into share/, and the libexec
programs are now in libexec/ (was previously libexec/squid/). See
configure --help for instructions on how to move these around to
exacly where you want to have them in your system.</LI>

corruption issues, and some aufs performance improvements.</LI>
<LI>now possible to specify acl values with spaces in them
via the "include file" technique</LI>
<LI>winbind helpers updated to match Samba-2.2.7a and should
work with Samba-2.2.6 or later (required). For compability with

has been added to allow you to specify which Samba version the
helpers should be built for if different than the above versions.</LI>
<LI>squid_ldap_group updated to correctly handle LDAP groups</LI>
<LI>new experimental configure option --disable-hostname-checks to make Squid not validate that received hostnames are valid for use within HTTP. Required to participate in testbeds for international domain names etc.</LI>
<LI>several assertion or segmentation faults corrected</LI>
<LI>a large number of minor bugfixes. See the list of 
<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v2/2.5/bugs/#STABLE1">squid-2.5.STABLE1 patches</A> and the

<LI>Lithuanian error messages added</LI>
<LI>a crash related to ftpTimeout: timeout in SENT_PASV state corrected</LI>
<LI>http_reply_access deny now logs the request with
TCP_DENIED to allow them to be accounted for properly in statistics</LI>
<LI>minimum_retry_timeout configuration directive removed. If
you have this directive in your existing squid.conf you will
need to remove the line. </LI>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>redirector interface modified to try to deal with login names
containing spaces or other odd characters. This is accomplished
by URL-encoding the login name before sent to redirectors. Note:
Existing redirectors or their configuration may need to be slightly
modified in how they process the ident column to support the new
username format (only applies to redirectors looking into the username)</LI>
<LI>new forward_timeout option to complement connect_timeout in
management of timeouts while connecting to origin servers or peers</LI>
<LI>various timeouts adjusted: connect_timeout 1 minute (was 2 minutes
which is now forward_timeout), negative_dns_ttl 1 minute (was 5 minutes)
and is now also used as minimum positive dns ttl, dns_timeout 2 minutes
(was 5 minutes)</LI>
<LI>"short_icon_urls on" can be used to simplify the URLs used for
icons etc to avoid issues with proxy host naming and authentication
when requesting icons.</LI>
<LI>A new "urllogin" ACL type has been introducing allowing regex
matches to the "login" component of Internet style URLs
(protocol://user:password@host/path/to/file).</LI>
<LI>Squid now respects the Telnet protocol on connections to FTP
servers. The ftp_telnet_protocol directice can be used to revert back
to the old incorrect implementation.</LI>
<LI>Several NTLM related bugfixes and improvements fixing the problem
of random auth popups and account lockouts. Support for the NEGOTIATE
NTLM packet is also added to allow Samba-3.0.2 or later to negotiate the
use of NTLMv2.</LI>

to work in additional acl driven directives, correct an number
of assertion or segmentation and some memory leaks.</LI>
<LI>The default mime.conf has been updated with many new mime types
and a few minor corrections. In addition the download and view links
is used more frequently to allow view/download of different ftp://
contents regardless of their mime type assignment.</LI>
<LI>url_regex enhanced to allow matching of %00</LI>
<LI>a large number of minor and cosmetic bugfixes. See the list of 
<A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v2/2.5/bugs/#STABLE4">squid-2.5.STABLE4 patches</A> and the
