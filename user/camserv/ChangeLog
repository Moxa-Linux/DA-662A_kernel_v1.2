        -----------  Version 0.5.1 --------------
2002-09-15  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

	*  Incorporate patches from Barak Pearlmutter <bap@cs.unm.edu>,
	   which cleaned up code, made things more portable, etc.  

	*  Also fixed up the build to work with newer versions of AutoMake

2002-05-12  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

	*  Included patch from Walter Haidinger (walter.haidinger@gmx.at)
	   which fixes up support for YUV420P based v4l devices (such as 
	   the Philips camera)

        -----------  Version 0.5.0 --------------
2002-03-10  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

        *  Did this the other day, but: cleaned up a huge amount of the build.
           where shared libs were stored, automatically generate some of
           the config, etc.  Should be much cleaner, now (and have gdk-pixbuf,
           etc., work)

2002-03-07  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

        *  Comitted patch from Scott Presnell to fix up a small quirk with
           singleframe requests

        *  Comitted patch from Walter Haidinger to fixup log entry formats, and
           YUV palette.

        *  Comitted a patch from Norbert Preining which looks for more
           defaults for the config files

        -----------  Version 0.42 --------------
2000-02-13  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

        *  Re-added GDK-pixbuf support, updated for new version of Imlib2
           support.
        
2000-02-12  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

        *  Finished adding patches from different *BSD authors.  Added
           JavaScript example for IE users, and fixed a minor bug with
           stuff blowing up on FPS calculations.
        
        -----------  Version 0.40 --------------
1999-11-18  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

        *  Finished up initial port of the FreeBSD bttv driver.  Appears
           to be pretty solid & quick.  Another release... Yay!
        
1999-11-15  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

        *  Fixed up to use the proper libdtl calls for all the symbol
           linking in.  This fixes up for people who want to use
           FreeBSD, and possibly other arch's.  Also fixed lame problem
           with server sockets not haveing REUSEADDR set @ the appropriate
           time, causing people to get pissed off waiting to restart their
           server.

1999-11-14  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

        *  Rehashed the relay to use the sockfield code.
        
1999-11-07  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

        *  Fixed a problem with the new singlepic code -- it was 
           interfering with the proxy code, and sending out an invalid
           preamble. 
        
2002-11-06  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

        *  Created a new gdk-pixbuf filter, which is almost identical
           to the imlib2 one.  Too bad it seems as though there isn't
           any stable installation for either of these packages.
        
2002-11-05  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

        *  Created a new filter using the imlib2 library to filter the
           camera images through filters. Gratuitous BOLOGNA!!!

        
2002-11-05  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

        *  Added Patches from Joerg Henne (jh@cogito.de) to handle
           non NTSC input devices.  He also submitted patches for
           Single-shot camera pix as well as resource limitations
           on clients.
        
2002-11-04  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

        *  Removed glib dependency, created new configuration setup.
           More elegent socket closing.  Updated module interface
           slightly.

**COMPAT** New configuration file format -- drastically different from
           old versions.
        
2002-10-31  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

        *  Updated to allow the user to specify a 'goal' for the 
           autobrightness adjustments.  
           
        *   Updated to allow taking of single pictures and then exiting
           using output_snapfile, and output_presnaps
           
        *   Created the video_basic module to provide an example for how
           to program a video module.
        
2002-10-28  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

        *  Added support for auto brightness adjusting every so often.
           Also added the ability for people to use the whiteval
           setting on their cameras.  Also changed the way that
           camera settings are interpted (hue, contrast, etc)

**COMPAT** vidmod_{color,hue,contrast,brightness,whiteness} are now
           in the range of 0->60000, not the crazy thing they were before.

        ---------- Version 0.30 ---------------
2002-10-27  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

        *  Added new relay program to do camserv relays.

**COMPAT** Changed the `channel` reference in the configuration file
           to `port`, because people were getting confused about the
           meaning.
        
        ---------- Version 0.20 ----------------
2002-10-25  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

        *  Fixed the the configure scripts to detect invalid jpeg
           libraries or video4linux were installed.  If not, then
           "the right thing" happens wrt which files are compiled.
        
2002-10-25  Jon Travis  <jtravis@p00p.org>

        *  Added maxfps variable & cruddy approximation to do sleeping to
           keep the fps about average.
