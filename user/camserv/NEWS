02-13-1999:  Release 0.42 with changes for FreeBSD/NetBSD tunability, minor
             bugfixes && IE Javascript support.  Also re-added GDK-PIXBUF

             to support.

             of bugfixes & features, and a new FreeBSD camera module.

             a new program to do relaying of the camera pictures.
