Installation Instructions for the Universal NFS Server 2.2.
-----------------------------------------------------------

To compile nfsd and its fellow programs, do the following:

1.	Configure the package for your system. This is a two-step process.

	You first have to run the BUILD script that will ask you some
	questions for your site-specific configuration. It will then create
	the file site.h and site.mk, and invoke the GNU configure script.

	The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values
	for various system-dependent variables used during compilation,
	and creates the Makefile and the config.h header file.
	It also creates a file `config.status' that you can run in the
	future to recreate the current configuration.

2.	Type `make' to compile the package. By default, the package is
	compiled with optimization (-O).  If you want, you can override
	the `make' variables CFLAGS and LDFLAGS like this:

	make CFLAGS=-O6 LDFLAGS=-s

4.	Type `make install' to install the programs and documentation.
	By default, all programs are installed in /usr/sbin.

5.	You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
	source directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
	Makefile, the header file containing system-dependent
	definitions and `config.status' (all the files that `configure'
	created), type `make distclean'.

The file `configure.in' is used as a template to create `configure' by
a program called `autoconf'.  You will only need it if you want to
regenerate `configure'. The current configure.in script requires 
GNU autoconf version 2 or above.
