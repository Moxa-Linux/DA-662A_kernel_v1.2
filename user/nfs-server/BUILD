#  Feb 1997 - added batch configuration via command line options.
#	--batch		don't ask questions
#	--multi		enable multiple server processes
#	--devtab=yes/no	enable new devtab inode numbers for big disks
#	--ugidd=yes/no	enable/disable support for ugidd
#	--nis=yes/no	enabled NIS-based uid mapping
#	--hosts-access=yes/no
#			Use hosts.allow/hosts.deny to limit access
#			to ugidd and mountd to certain hosts.
#	--libwrap-directory=pathname
#			Specify the directory where libwrap.a can
#			be found, if not in the default lib path.
#	--exports-uid=uid
#	--exports-gid=gid
#			Define uid and gid of the exports file owner.
#			Whenever mountd accesses /etc/exports, it

***********************************************************
*     Universal NFS Server $VERSION Autoconfiguration    *
***********************************************************

   This package is BETA software. Until the final 2.2
   is released, please make sure you are using the latest
   version that you can get from
     
   ftp://linux.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/pub/linux/people/okir

   Please also make sure you replace any older versions
   of unfsd you are running.  Versions of the Universal
   NFS Server prior to 2.2 had some security holes.

   Caveat: although the Universal NFS Server 2.0 was
   originally written to support a set of different
   platfroms, including AIX, SunOS and others, versions
   above 2.0 were developed on Linux only. Thus, there
   may be some portability problems on other OSes.

   If you have a bug report, please follow the instructions
   in the file BUGS.

EOF
# -------------- blurb excerpt removed -----------------
#  This version is based on Olaf's version 2.2beta1
#  with automatic exports access control and hooks for
#  the experimental FoxbatSARS by Alex Yuriev.

****************************************************************

****************************************************************

    Please answer the following questions to make the system
    specific changes in configuration of the UNFS Server.

EOF

cat << EOF
+------------------+
| Big HD support   |
+------------------+

This release of unfsd has experimental support for a new inode number
generation scheme that should work better with large disks. If you
have experienced problems with files suddenly turning into direcotries,
or vice versa, try this feature.

EOF
DEVTAB=`read_yesno "Enable new inode number scheme?" n $devtab`

if [ "$DEVTAB" = Y ]; then
	echo 
	echo "The NFS server will need a file in which to store the device number mapping."
	echo -n "Please enter file name [/var/state/nfs/devtab]: "
	read PATH_DEVTAB
	if [ -z "$PATH_DEVTAB" ]; then
		PATH_DEVTAB=/var/state/nfs/devtab
	fi
	echo
fi

cat << EOF
+------------------+
| Multiple Servers |
+------------------+

This release of unfsd has support for running multiple server processes
in read/write mode (previous release were strictly read-only when running
more than one NFS daemon).

EOF
MULTI_NFSD=`read_yesno "Enable R/W support for multiple daemons?" y $multi`

cat << EOF
+---------------------+
| Dynamic UID mapping +
+---------------------+

This release of unfsd supports dynamic mapping of uids and gids between
hosts with different uid spaces. There are several flavors of uid mapping:

 *	Using a separate daemon named rpc.ugidd.
 *	Using the client host's NIS server.
 *	Using a static mapping file.

Static mapping is always supported; if you want one of the dynamic mapping
flavors, you have to select them now.

Note that you should not use ugidd mapping unless you absolutely must,
because it can pose a security risk: When run unprotected, the ugidd
mapping daemon can be abused to obtain a complete list of all login
names on your NFS client machine. As a counter-measure, ugidd can
be protected with the hosts_access control mechanism used by Wietse
Venema's tcp_wrapper package. Note that this does not offer a hundred
percent protection, though, as it can still be spoofed by hosts on the
same network as your client machine.

EOF

USE_UGIDD=`read_yesno "Are you going to use ugidd? (not recommended)" n $ugidd`
if [ "$USE_UGIDD" = "Y" ]; then
  echo " What can I say, its your system. I will use ugidd to map uid/gids."
else
  echo " Good, I never liked ugidd."
fi

USE_NIS=`read_yesno "Are you going to use NIS uid mapping?" n $nis`

cat << EOF

+------------------------------+
| Access control configuration |
+------------------------------+

Unfsd makes sure the exports file is always owned by the same user, and
is not writable by anyone but that user. I will now ask you for the uid
and gid of that user. Please enter appropriate user and group ids or names.

EOF

EXPSOWNUID=`read_ugid --user "Which uid should own /etc/exports?" 0 "(root)" $exports_uid`
EXPSOWNGID=`read_ugid --group "Which gid should own /etc/exports?" 0 "(root)" $exports_gid`

cat << EOF

Mountd and ugidd (if you enabled it) can be protected from illegal access
with the hosts_access control mechanism used by Wietse Venema's
tcp_wrapper package. Note that this does not offer a hundred percent
protection, though, as it can still be spoofed by hosts on the same
network as your client machine.

Especially if you run ugidd, enabling this is highly recommended.
