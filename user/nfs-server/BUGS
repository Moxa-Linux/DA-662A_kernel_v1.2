	If you suspect a bug with nfsd, please report it to

		unfsd@monad.swb.de

	I will try to answer you ASAP. Please make sure to include
	the following information in your bug report:

	 *	Version of nfsd you're using.
	 *	The client with which these problems occur (OS, ...).
	 *	What compiler you used to compile nfsd. If you run
		gcc-elf, please check if the problem also exists when
		you make nfsd with a.out.
	 *	Your /etc/exports file, or relevant parts thereof.
	 *	Unless it's too large, a debug trace of the problem.
		Refer to the nfsd manpage on how to make nfsd generate
		a debug trace.

	These informations will likely help me find any bugs faster.


	FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY

	If you send a debug trace that contains file handle data,
	please consider using PGP to encrypt it. Anyone intercepting
	your mail can abuse these file handles to do bad things to your
	NFS server if it's not firewalled. My PGP key is available by
	fingering okir@brewhq.swb.de.

	Also, when reporting bugs on Usenet, it is *not* wise to
	post your exports file or debug traces that contain address or
	file handle data unless you are sure your NFS server is not
	reachable from the Internet.


	Thank you for your cooperation
	Olaf
