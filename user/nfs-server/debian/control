Description: User space NFS server.
 This package contains all necessary programs to make your Linux machine act
 as an NFS server, being an NFS daemon (rpc.nfsd), a mount daemon (rpc.mountd).
 .
 Unlike other NFS daemons, this NFS server runs entirely in user space.  This
 makes it a tad slower than other NFS implementations, and also introduces
 some awkwardnesses in the semantics (for instance, moving a file to a
 different directory will render its file handle invalid).
