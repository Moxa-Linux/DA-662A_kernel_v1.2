Changes from 2.0 to 2.2

* Support for multiple nfsd's running in parallel.
* Implement root_squash and no_root_squash mount options. Note: root_squash
  is on by default, so you have to insert no_root_squash where appropriate
  or your configuration might break.
* New set of uid squash options: squash_uids, squash_gids (specify
  list of uids/gids to squash), all_squash, anon_uid and anon_gid
  (override uid/gid of anon user for specific clients), noaccess (exclude
  subdirectories).
* Different log levels for debugging.
* Netmask/netgroup support in /etc/exports.
* mountd now supports /etc/rmtab and showmount -a.
* export file re-reading with SIGHUP in nfsd and mountd.
* Interactive BUILD script.
* Uid/gid mapping:
    -	using Mark Shand's ugidd.
    -	using a file for static mapping.
    -	NIS-based mapping querying the client's NIS server.
* Patch to perform per-call profiling of the server.
* authenticate fh's on every request.
* Use setfsuid/setfsgid if available for setting owner/group on file
  access rather than seteuid.
* Fixed a fair number of bugs.
* Support for WebNFS
* Run multiple server processes

* mentioning a client twice in the exports file doesn't cause looping
* rogue clients cannot search past a mount point
