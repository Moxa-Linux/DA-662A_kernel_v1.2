Rule:  
alert udp $EXTERNAL_NET 60000 -> $HOME_NET 2140 (msg:"BACKDOOR DeepThroat
3.1 Client Sending Data to Server on Network"; reference:arachnids,106;
sid:151; classtype:misc-activity; rev:3;)

--
Sid:
151

--
Summary:
This signature indicates that a DeepThroat client has ordered a DeepThroat 
trojaned machine on $HOME_NET to do something. 

--
Impact:
A remote attacker with DeepThroat access has almost full control of the
trojaned machine, including file manipulation and download, keystroke
logging, password scavenging, and reboot. Additionally, the trojan includes 
a port redirector, and IRC bot, and a tool to scan for other DeepThroat
infected machines. There are also prank-type annoyances.

--
Detailed Information:
DeepThroat is a full-featured remote access trojan.It contains many kiddie
tools, including window enumeration and manipulation; file searching
launching and deletion; remote graphics display sound playing and wallpaper
alteration; remote website launching and file download; shell alteration 
(e.g. hiding systray or Start button), CD-ROM open/closing, mouse button 
swapping; screen resolution change, display on/off; password scavenging and
screen capturing. It also includes a remotely activated FTP server, a keystroke
logger, an IRC bot, a port redirector, and a tool to scan for other DeepThroat 
servers. Using these tools, an attacker can not only take control of the 
infected machine, but can use it as a relay to attack others or scan
for more infected machines from within your network.  By default, DeepThroat sends its 
control commands to port 2140 on the trojaned machine.

--
Attack Scenarios:
Users must be actively enticed into installing the trojan, using any of the
normal social-engineering means. Alternatively, an attacker with physical
access to the machine could simply install it himself.

--
Ease of Attack:
Very simple. This is a point-and-click tool. The toughest part is convincing 
a user to install it, and it could certainly be bound to another binary for 
easier social-engineering.

False Positives:

False Negatives:

--
Corrective Action:
Mitigation:
Block UDP port 2140 (standard DeepThroat control port), if possible TCP port 21
(standard DeepThroat FTP server), and TCP port 999 (DeepThroat keyboard logger). 
DeepThroat may be set up to run on other ports than those listed above. Removal 
is the only sure mitigation.

Removal:
Scan with an anti-virus tool and follow the removal instructions.
