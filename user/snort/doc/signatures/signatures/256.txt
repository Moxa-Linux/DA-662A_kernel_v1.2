Sid:

--
Summary:
An attempt was made to query authors.bind chaos record on your DNS server.  
--
Impact:
Allows a remote attacker to possibly determine the version of bind
you are running.

--
Detailed Information:
Bind 9.x allows you get the authors.bind chaos record.  The ability to
retrieve this file indicates that the machine is running at least a
9.x variant of the bind nameserver.

--
Attack Scenarios:
As part of a reconnaissance mission, an attacker may attempt to gleen
important information about your infrastructure by determining your
bind version.  If authors.bind is retrievable, this indicates that you
are running Bind 9.x.  If not, it means nothing.  This, in addition to
possibly retrieving version.bind, allows attackers to craft attacks
specially suited for your environment.

Ease of Attack:
Trivial:

[~]$ dig +short @testhost.com txt chaos authors.bind

"Bob Halley"
"Mark Andrews"
"James Brister"

"David Lawrence"

"Brian Wellington"
"Andreas Gustafsson"
