Summary:
Using two or more windows file extensions, mail users have
difficulties to determine the type of attachments an probably
execute a file or script while thinking it is a harmless picture.

--
Impact:
Mail worms may spread rapidly because users execute them.

--
Detailed Information:
Windows systems are often configured not to display file extensions.
By adding a second extension, users get confused and think that an
executable is a picture - e.g. niceboy.jpg.vbs gets displayed as
nicegboy.jpg but is a visual basic script and not a picture.

--
Attack Scenarios:
Famous worms (ILOVEYOU, KOURNIKOVA) are based on this method.

--
Ease of Attack:
Very easy. One needs to attach a file and hope that it gets executed.

--
False Positives:
Could be an error on sender's side.

--
False Negatives:
-

--
Corrective Action:
Use antivirus software. Configure mail clients securely, especially when
using windows desktops. Educate your mail users. Deny all attachments at
the gateway if you can.
