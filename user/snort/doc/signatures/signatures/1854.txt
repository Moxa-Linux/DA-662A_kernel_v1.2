alert icmp $EXTERNAL_NET any <> $HOME_NET any (msg:"DDOS Stacheldraht
handler->agent (niggahbitch)"; content: "|6E 69 67 67 61 68 62 69 74 63

Sid:
--
Summary:
Varient of Stacheldraht DDOS tool
--
Impact:
Likely you have a compromised machine and your machine is being used as a
ddos zombie.
--
Detailed Information:
This signature is based on traffic caught in the wild. Stracheldraht is a
Distributed denial of service tool normally found on Sun Solaris machines.
It is made up of a Client, handler and agent. The clients connects to the
handler. Handlers can connect with up to 1000 agents. Communication between
the client and the handler is conducted using tcp and the communication
between the handler and the agent can be either tcp or icmp_echoreply. This
signature detects the a message sent from the handler to the agent. This
traffic differs from the traffic described on
http://staff.washington.edu/dittrich/misc/stacheldraht.analysis because the
packets have an icmp id of 9015 rather than 1000 as noted in the analysis.

--
Attack Scenarios:
The agent can be used to mount a distributed denial of service attack. It
also means that a machine is compromised.
--
Ease of Attack:

--
False Positives: Should not be any.
--
False Negatives: The icmp id along with the keywords may be changed in the
source code to hide this traffic from beng detected
--
Corrective Action:
Take the machine off line asap and rebuild with a completely new install.
