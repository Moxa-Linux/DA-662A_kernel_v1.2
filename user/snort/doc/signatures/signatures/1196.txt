Sid:
1196

--

Summary:
Possible remote execution attack detected against sgi IRIX infosrch.cgi
web application.

--
Impact:
An attacker may have abused the infosrch.cgi web application that ships
with IRIX 6.5 to remotely execute arbitrary commands as the webserver user.

--
Detailed Information:
sgi IRIX 6.5 through 6.5.7 ships with a web application called InfoSearch
that is vulnerable to a remote execution attack.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker uses an existing, publically known exploit script, or
sends a simple, handcrafted URL to the webserver such as:
http://target/cgi-bin/infosrch.cgi?cmd=getdoc&db=man&fname=|/bin/id

--
Ease of Attack:
Automated exploit scripts are publically known.  Alternatively,
handcrafting a malicious URL is easy.

--
False Positives:
The InfoSearch web application may legitimately be used to browse system
documentation.

--
False Negatives:

--
Corrective Action:
Examine the packet to determine whether malicious code was contained in
the fname HTTP GET variable, such as unix shell commands.  If it looks
like it may have been malicious code, determine whether the targetted
web server was running a vulnerable version of IRIX.
